             <p class="title">Use of Relative Size</p>
             <article>
                <p>
                    Using relatives sizes such as 'rem', 'em', '%' actually makes a difference in sizing of an element making the 
                    element responsive in an appropriate way relating to the developers way. Using root em makes the, for instance,
                    the font relative to the root element or the html. Unless specified, html is usually 16px so, when addressing 1rem
                    2 rem, adjusts the elements font size in relative to the 16px root size. This is helpful in mainly two ways. One, 
                    if for example we needed to enlarge the entire document while keeping proportion we only need to change the root 
                    size as every element that used rem will change based on the rem value ratio. The same goes for em as it will help 
                    control based on its container. The second effect can be taken regarding zooming of browsers. In using absolute size,
                    a lose of structure will result as the elements are specified a distinct value and won't change in accordance of the 
                    zooming which, if using for example % value, will adjust based on the container size. This % functions based on the 
                    files values so changing in proportion in the process of zooming. Hence, using relative size matters in structuring
                    our html.

                     the previous versions

                     <element class="point"> More Effective :</element>
                     CSS3 provides an option that does not require a combo between Javascript and CSS which saves time.
                     Websites built with CSS3 are also ranked higher than one's with CSS making it more effective. It 
                     generally has grown more flexible and this results are mostly based on its improved and simpler

                    In the improved cascade styling, you can use images as borders and create different styles. In the 
                    text manipulation angle, effects has been added such as drop shadow effect giving your website a good 
                    look. You can also make your web content flow in the columns, saving you time in scrolling because of 
                    the multi column module

                    <element class="point"> Grid Layout : </element>
                    It is a two dimensional system for building page layout. If you define grid columns and rows using its syntax
                    that are not less than the actual grid then it is an explicit grid or else implicit. This grid also allows 
                    flexibility in length by allocating width and height in its space.

                <p>

                    and simpler usage
